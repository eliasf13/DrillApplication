# DrillApplication

In this project, my team and I continued developing the core application with a focus on extending its functionality.
A key enhancement was the extraction of features using tsfresh, which are used to predict the material involved in drilling processes.
At the same time, we redesigned parts of the app to improve the user experience and implemented a new algorithm capable of processing and integrating both historical and live data.
This enables real-time insights and provides a visual representation of the data.
