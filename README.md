# DrillApplication

In this project, my team and I continued developing the core application with a focus on extending its functionality. 
A key enhancement was the integration of a feature that predicts the material used in drilling processes and presents the data visually. 
At the same time, we redesigned parts of the app to improve user experience and implemented a new algorithm capable of processing and merging both historical and live data. 
This enables more accurate predictions and real-time insight.
